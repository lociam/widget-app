# Description

Welcome to `WidgetApp`. This is a simple Spring boot aplication
that allows you to Add / Modify / Get / Delete widgets via a REST
api that will be explained later in this document.

This project was created using the spring boot helper. That created
the basic bootstrap.

Springfox was added as a dependency to add a swagger documentation.

## How to run

You need Java 11 in order to run the web server.

To run this project you need to run:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

It will start the web server in the port `8080`.

After running it, you can find the documentation at:

`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
`

You can choose which DB implementation should be used by 
modifying the property `widget.repository` in the application.properties.
If you use `widget.repository=mem` it will use the InMemory implementation.
If you use `widget.repository=db` it will use the H2 DB implementation.
